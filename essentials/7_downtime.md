Cat-girls will typically sleep about 10-14 hours a day. Some owners claim they need so much sleep because of their supercharged levels of energy for the rest of the day! She will usually curl up with her master before naps. This is an excellent time for bonding by petting and stroking her. She will indicate her contentment by a rhythmic purring and her ears laying slight back and down. She may smile and sigh and snuggle against you and "kneed" her fingers in your legs. Cat-girls have been shown to have a therapeutic affect on individuals suffering from depression and high levels of stress. Depending on her age she may even attempt to nurse on finger or piece of cloth! Don't be offended, this is a singular honor your cat girl is paying you unconsciously.

It is your choice as to the disposition of her sleeping arrangements. Some owners have a normal human bed prepared, others a small cushioned area for her to stretch out on. Still others allow their cat-girl to sleep in the same bed. Regardless of your choice it is important to mark her sleeping space with your scent. However your cat-girl may wish to make her own sleeping arrangements Allow her to explore a bit. Strays and ferals are more prone to sleeping alone in their home till they get used to their new life. Then they usually desire the presence of their master while sleeping. Cat-girls rarely sleep in clothing they generally find it too constricting so be sure their clean clothing is nearby for dressing when they awaken. Ferals and strays are usually extremely difficult to relocate from the owner's bed if they have gotten used to sleeping there, be alert to this. They will jealously and even violently defend their sleeping privilege against dog-girls and rabbit girls and even human females! So be warned if you let your cat-girl share your bed on regular basis.
