Your new cat-girl has particular dietary concerns. A proper diet will ensure a fit, active and healthy companion of many years. A poor diet can result in an overweight, lethargic cat-girl with serious health issues.

Your cat-girl is bred to be specifically compatible with most human food. However particular care must be given avoid certain types of food except for occasional treats.

A proper diet consists of a large amount of daily protein intake to keep her happy and active.

We suggest: 50% low-fat meats, chicken, fish, and beef. She can eat them raw or cooked. It is suggested that the majority of her meat to be cooked to avoid possible intestinal parasites and to keep her breath smelling acceptable. Kitty-Klean mouthwash is highly recommended in any event.

40% fresh vegetables and fruits. You cat-girl should immediately express an interest in fresh greenery. Encourage this. A cat-girl eating plenty of greens is cute to watch and is a cat-girl with a healthy digestive tract. IF your cat-girl is reluctant to eat fruits and vegetables, encourage her with the application of Krazy-Kat protein spray on them. It's delicious!

8% Grains. Cat girls enjoy occasional grains such as rice, barley and the like. Be careful with these! They can make her feel unpleasantly bloated!

2% or less Sugary Snacks . Your cat-girl will love sugary snacks. They are NOT good for her! It will give her energy and taste delicious but provide no nutrition! Save sugary snacks for a special treat. Alcohol: should never be given to your cat-girl. It is metabolized in them in a similar fashion to humans. But an amount that would get an average person "buzzed" will likely have them passed out. Fortunately the smell of liquor is generally reviled by most breeds and can used to on objects to discourage their interest.

If your cat-girl begins to develop a belly, you should first cut back on sweets and attempt more vigorous exercise routines and longer play-time with her. If your cat-girl is from a less active breed you can control her weight by reducing the meal portion sizes and breaking them up over a period of time during the course of a day. It is important to keep your cat-girl on a schedule of feeding and to avoid snacking. Do not reward her begging. We know that can be darn hard!! But remember it's for her own good! If you choose to take your meals with your cat girl at the table, it is best to let her have her own bowl. Utensils may not be required. Some of the more intelligent breeds are instinctive mimics and derive pleasure from imitating their masters with utensils. If she doesn't appear to want to use or be interested in utensils do NOT force them on her. Remember, cat-girls can be quite stubborn.
