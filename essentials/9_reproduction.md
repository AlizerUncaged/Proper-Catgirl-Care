Your cat-girl, upon sexual maturity usually in her 5-7th year, will go into "season" 3-4 times a year. During this time she will be sexually receptive and capable of conceiving. Do not breed your cat-girl unless under the strict supervision of a Licensed and Accredited Breeder Registered cat-boys are rare and rigorously screened for genetic defects; a mating with an unlicensed male can produce still born offspring or worse! *

Identifying that your cat-girl is in "season" or "heat" is fairly easy. She will be flushed in the face. She will be even more insistent for your affection, often in socially awkward ways. She may even avoid you and alternate between extremes of affection and anger!

Her behavior may envince in appropriate behaviors in front of other. She may begin touching her genitals and may insist that you do so as well in inappropriate situations. Your cat-girl may "present" at you randomly getting on all fours and lifting her buttocks towards you and even attempt to have you mount her during bathing or grooming, by awkwardly pulling you onto her. She may rub up inappropriately against objects for sexual stimulation.

This awkward behavior can be handled thusly: Cat-CareCo.'s Feline Relief pills. They contain a synthetic progesterone analogue to suppress the ovulation cycle and a mild tranquilizer to minimize the undesired behaviors. A single pill with her morning meal will keep her decently calm for up to 24-32 hours. The known side effects are excessive sleeping, headache, nausea and lack of appetite. This is an excellent option for owners during busy work periods or owners that are a bit squeamish about their cat-girls breeding cycle. If drug control of your cat-girl's ovulation is contraindicated by current medication or an aversion to synthetic hormones or if financial issues prevent purchase there exist other options for the prudent owner.

The worst of your cat girl's behaviors can be mitigated with daily manual stimulation during her ovulation week. Make sure your hands are clean and/or you are wearing a latex glove. When she "presents" kneel behind her and pull her pants down, spread her thighs as needed. Place one hand on the small of her back just above the tail and apply firm pressure this simulates the weight of a male Take the other hand and gently insert your fore finger into her vagina. The number of fingers will depend upon the build of your cat-girl. Given the state of her agitation you may need to add an additional finger or two. She should not require lubrication if in season. The cat-girl vagina was modeled closely on the human female vagina to facilitate easier care. Curl the finger(s) slightly upward and work them up to the last knuckle in a back and forth motion. Start slowly and work up to a fast and firm pace. Your cat-girl should begin to vocalize (moan, mew, whimper, growl) and tightly contract her vaginal muscles against your fingers and press her hips back against your hand. She will climax at least once over 3-5 minutes, perhaps more. Her climax (analogous to a human female's orgasm) is usually indicated by loud vocalizations, rhymic contractions of her vagina followed by slumping over, ragged breathing and panting. At this point, it is usually a good idea to give her a break.

Continue finger insertion until this occurs, and then rapidly and with force insert your fingers several more times and then stop while pushing the tips of your fingers firmly against her cervix for several seconds. *this simulates the male's orgasm" The extra force you use to simulate male climax will not injure her, as a male's penis is knobby and covered with nurled spines, and can be generally fairly painful for your cat-girl, so even if you are fairly clumsy and unsure it will be difficult to cause her discomfort or injury. Now spent, this is a good time to wipe her vagina of the accumulated sexual lubrication fluids she has produced in abundance. You may notice a scent of salty and slightly sweet. This is normal. She may shake uncontrollably if you wipe her with too much pressure, so be gentle!

She's had an exhausting run! Stroke her hair gently and talk encouragingly to her. This is a time of extremes of emotion, stress and agitation for your cat-girl. Please be supportive and extra kind to her during this period! She may sleep, or rest for a bit and likely awake and seek another round of stimulation. The first round is generally the longest, next time or two can usually be brief. At this point it is generally unlikely she will require more attention till the next day. This will depend on your cat-girl's personality.

Exercise care bathing her after this as her genitals will likely be a bit puffy, red and very sensitive. If she seeks additional stimulation while bathing you can accomplish relief for her by locating and gently manipulating her clitoris in slow clockwise and counter-clockwise circles. At this point, stimulation of her nipples by fingers or mouth will likely be appreciated. If she indicates she desires manual insertion you may do so at your discretion. Her climax may take a bit and be particularly intense and emotional for her, which may be expressed as crying, sobbing or clutching onto you, but will put her out of commission for a while and you can have a well deserved break. Your cat-girl will likely spend the time you have together that day afterwards being especially attentive and affectionate towards you. You may wish to give her a favorite treat or toy to settle her further down. If she "presents" again in the evening, it is the owner's choice to indulge her or not if she is not demonstrating distress. This offer for stimulation is most likely a desire to bond further with her master not a desperate hormone induced plea. It is not a good idea to provide manual stimulation in your bed or sleeping area, lest she come to associate mating with the sleeping arrangements! If you live alone this may not be a problem. If you have a significant other, they may very well take that amiss!
