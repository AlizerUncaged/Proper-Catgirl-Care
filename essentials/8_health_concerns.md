Cat girl breeds are specifically tested and monitored to ensure the maximum healthy lifespan and identify any possible weaknesses in them. Your cat-girl will require a visit to your local Cat-Girl Health Care Provider within 6 months to insure that she is settling in with her master and that no lurking health issues have yet to surface, then visits yearly thereafter. The CGHCP will give you an overall view her health and any additional advice or lifestyle/feeding changes that may be needed. All approved breeders are carefully monitored to ensure the litters produced are full of healthy, energetic and intelligent kittens. Genetic screening on kittens is done in the first few weeks following birth to make sure all gene markers are within norms. This will ensure cat-girl companions that will have long and happy lives. The average life of your cat-girl will depend on the breed but due to advances in nano-tech you can easily expect a lifelong companion!

It is still of vital importance for owners watch over their cat-girls overall health under the guidance of an accredited CGHCP. Important! If you notice sudden changes in your cat-girls temperament, bowel movements, appetite and/or vomiting or diarrhea than last more than 24 hours: Contact your CGHCP IMMEDIATELY!
