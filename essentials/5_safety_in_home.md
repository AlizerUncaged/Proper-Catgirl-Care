Your cat-girl is an inquisitive, bright and intelligent being. Depending on the breed and specific breeder plans your cat-girl will be at least as intelligent as a 5 year old human toddler to being almost indistinguishable from a late teenage girl. These descriptions are not entirely comparable as she will in either case be a fully functional member of her own species regardless. And as such they will crave stimulation and activity in levels determined by breed, intelligence and personality. Luckily for you, she will be distracted by almost anything. Any of the Petgirlco line of cat-girl toys will keep her endlessly entertained. Keep in mind the best playtime she will have will be when YOU are playing with her. She will enjoy stalking and pouncing on you if you are so inclined or watching TV, or observing you in your hobbies. If you allow this be SURE to correct her if she bites while roughhousing. When she is done playing be sure to stop. Some cat-girls, from the more intelligent breeds, may show interest in particular TV shows and even books! Teaching your cat-girl basic literacy is possible, again depending on your patience, her breed and personality. You may find having a fairly articulate and literate cat-girl a bit more of a handful than some Owners who do not encourage this, but you will have companion that can react better in an emergency involving you or her home and to say nothing of a companion you can converse with!

You should generally keep your cat-girl indoors unless accompanied by you or a household member. Many owners enjoy taking their cat-girl out shopping and to parks to play. This can be a bit risky with other cat-girls and dog-girls around. If she is well trained and an intelligent breed, outings may prove beneficial to her advanced socialization and acquiring additional life skills. It is important to keep her in check as the outside world will be full of sights smells and other -girl animals she has not experienced. The situation may be a bit daunting for her at first. Try time in the yard first. Progress to short trips around the neighborhood. before leaving familiar areas. Most cat-girls if coaxed and encouraged can easily travel in cars and trains even on long trips. Be sure to bring toys and snacks!
