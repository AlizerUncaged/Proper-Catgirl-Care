Your cat girl will require basic clothing. Nothing too fancy at first is required. It is likely the shelter or breeder you received her from only had her wear basic t-shirts and pants/shorts. Almost any brand will do as long as they are cotton or natural fiber cat-girls have delicate skin. Undergarments' are at your discretion. Let your cat-girl smell and mark indicated rubbing her cheek against them the new clothing after you have handled the new clothing and rubbed them on your face before attempting to dress her in them. It is important she recognizes these clothes as gifts from her master your odor and are thus now hers her odor. Nicer, flashier clothing can be purchased later once your cat-girl settles into her new home, if you intend to Show or Breed her. Ferals and strays instinctively will wear whatever clothing they can scavenge. It is imperative that you get such a cat-girl her own clothing in accordance with the previously mentioned guidelines so that she will bond with you more quickly as her provider and caretaker. Be sure to undress a feral/stray with care when presenting her with new clothes. Her old clothes are a symbol of her old unbonded life and should be disposed of out her sight. Shoes are optional and should not be forced. Shoes should still be required when the temperature reaches near freezing, if traveling outdoors..
